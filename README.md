# FastChecking  
**FastChecking** is a mobile web app that helps users manage their budget quickly and efficiently. It focuses on simplicity and speed, making budget tracking less of a chore.

## Why This Project?  
FastChecking is a personal project born from a frustration: I couldn’t find a budgeting app on the App Store that truly matched my needs. I wanted something lightweight, fast, and focused only on the essentials. This project reflects my desire to create a tool that fits **my daily routine**, while learning new technologies in the process.

## Technologies Used  

FastChecking is a full-stack web application built with modern technologies.

### Backend:  
- **Spring Boot** – Robust backend framework for handling business logic and APIs

### Frontend:  
- **Angular** – Component-based frontend framework for building dynamic UIs  
- **Tailwind CSS** – Utility-first CSS for fast and responsive design  

### DevOps:  
- **Docker Compose** – To orchestrate multi-container setup for backend, frontend and database

## Main Features  

FastChecking focuses on core features that make budgeting intuitive:

1. **Add & Delete Transactions** – Quickly log new expenses or incomes by category  
2. **Live Balance Update** – Instantly reflects any transaction in the account balance  
3. **Monthly Overview** – Browse transactions by month for better tracking

## Future Features  

I'm planning to expand the app with several useful features, including:

- **Budget Goals** – Define monthly spending goals per category  
- **Custom Categories** – Create and manage personalized spending categories  
- **Autocomplete Transactions** – Speed up entry with smart suggestions based on past usage  

## Project Structure  

This project showcases modern full-stack development with a focus on modular code, responsive UI, and containerized environments. It serves as both a **functional budgeting tool** and a **learning playground** for advanced web development practices.
